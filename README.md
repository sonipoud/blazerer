# Weather Dashboard

## Descriptions
This website is about a weather dashboard where it provides a form in which the person can search a city and will be able to view the current weather conditions. The page will display city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index with the 5-day forecast. The page will display the search history of the city and when clicked on it, it will present current and future conditions for that city.
